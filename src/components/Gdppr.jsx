        The GDPR establishes the general obligations of data controllers and of
        those processing personal data on their behalf (processors). These
        include the obligation to implement appropriate security measures,
        according to the risk involved in the data processing operations they
        perform.

        Rights of individuals The GDPR lists the rights of the data subject,
        meaning the rights of the individuals whose personal data is being
        processed. These strengthened rights give individuals more control over
        their personal data, including through: the need for an individual's
        clear consent to the processing of his or her personal data easier
        access for the data subject to his or her personal data the right to
        rectification, to erasure and ‘to be forgotten’ the right to object,
        including to the use of personal data for the purposes of ‘profiling’
        the right to data portability from one service provider to another The
        regulation also lays down the obligation for controllers (those who are
        responsible for the processing of data) to provide transparent and
        easily accessible information to individuals on the processing of their
        data.
